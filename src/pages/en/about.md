As a Doctor in Psychology, Certified Clinical Psychologist and Psychotherapist, I specialise in the treatment of emotional disorders. Trained mainly in cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy, I incorporate tools from mindfulness therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT therapy) and transdiagnostic therapy. In September 2024, I also completed my doctorate in psychology at UCLouvain, which focused on the role of cognitive, emotional, and behavioural factors in stress regulation. I also supervised practical courses in clinical psychology for the Psychology bachelor's and master's degrees at UCLouvain. In addition to stress, I have a wide range of research interests, including cognitive flexibility, alexithymia, and sexual disorders.
