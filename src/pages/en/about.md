As a Doctor in Psychology, Certified Clinical Psychologist and Psychotherapist, I specialize in the treatment of emotional disorders. Trained primarily in cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy (CBT), I incorporate tools from Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Metacognitive Therapy, Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders, and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). My practice is anchored in a larger person-centered approach. 

Alongside my clinical practice, I am a researcher at Sciensano, where I focus on health promotion and prevention projects based on physical activity, mental health, and nutrition. I also supervise end-of-year projects for first- and final-year students in the postgraduate psychotherapy program (Integrated Psychotherapy Clinics) at UCLouvain. 

In September 2024, I completed my PhD in psychology at UCLouvain, which focused on the role of cognitive, emotional, and behavioural factors in stress regulation. I also supervised practical courses in clinical psychology for the Psychology bachelor's and master's degrees at UCLouvain. In addition to stress, mental health and physical activity, I have a wide range of research interests, including cognitive flexibility, alexithymia, and sexual disorders.
