As a trained clinical psychologist and psychotherapist, I specialise in the treatment of emotional disorders and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). I am currently finishing a doctorate in Psychology at UCLouvain, studying the role of cognitive, emotional, and behavioural capacities in stress regulation. I also supervise practical courses in clinical psychology for the Psychology bachelor's and master's degrees at UCLouvain. In addition to stress, I have a wide range of research interests, including cognitive flexibility, alexithymia, and sexual disorders.
