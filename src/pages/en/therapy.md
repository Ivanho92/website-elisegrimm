I specialize in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), an emotion-focused approach which aims to identify the mechanisms responsible for the emergence and maintenance of emotional difficulties. This approach explores the **cognitive** (e.g., depressive ruminations or anxious worries), **behavioral** (e.g., avoidance), **physiological** and **affective/emotional** aspects, which are often interconnected. CBT adopts an "empirically grounded" approach, based on the latest advances in scientific research.

The therapeutic process often begins with a session in which we assess the difficulties together. The follow-up modules are then chosen collaboratively and adapted according to the specific difficulties identified. This umbrella term encompasses various CBT-based therapies, including mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), ACT therapy, metacognitive therapy, transdiagnostic therapy, and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT).

## In Practice

Each session lasts **50 minutes** and can be conducted in French or English. It is advisable to begin therapy with weekly sessions, subsequently adjusting the frequency based on your needs.

## Difficulties Treated Include

-   Anxiety (panic attack, panic disorder, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, agoraphobia, specific phobia, etc.)
-   Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
-   Stress management (e.g. at school or university)
-   Professional burnout
-   Management of mental ruminations (anxious anticipations or preoccupations, depressive ruminations)
-   Perfectionism
-   Mood disorders (depression, chronic fatigue, etc.)
-   Self-confidence and assertiveness

## Group Therapy

I also offer different therapeutic groups focusing on 
- Ruminations and worrying 
- Self-confidence and assertiveness training
- Emotion identification and regulation. 

The number of participants is limited to 4-6 people. For further information about these groups, please feel free to contact me by email at [psychologue.elisegrimm@gmail.com](mailto:psychologue.elisegrimm@gmail.com).
