I specialize in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), an emotion-focused approach which aims to identify the mechanisms responsible for the emergence and maintenance of emotional difficulties. This approach explores the **cognitive** (e.g., depressive ruminations or anxious worries), **behavioral** (e.g., avoidance), **physiological** and **affective/emotional** aspects, which are often interconnected. CBT adopts an "empirically grounded" approach, based on the latest advances in scientific research. The therapeutic process often begins with a session in which we assess the difficulties together. The follow-up modules are then chosen collaboratively and adapted according to the specific difficulties identified. This umbrella term encompasses various CBT-based therapies, including mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), ACT therapy, metacognitive therapy and transdiagnostic therapy. For more information, please see the "Resources" tab.

## In practice
Each session lasts **one hour** and can be conducted in French or English. It is advisable to begin therapy with weekly sessions, subsequently adjusting the frequency based on your  needs.

## Difficulties treated include
- Anxiety (panic attack, panic disorder, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, agoraphobia, specific phobia, etc.)
- Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
- Stress management (e.g. at school or university)
- Professional or parental burnout
- Management of mental ruminations (anxious anticipations or preoccupations, depressive ruminations)
- Perfectionism
- Post-traumatic stress
- Mood disorders (chronic fatigue, depression, etc.)
- Self-confidence and assertiveness
- Eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia, hyperphagia)
