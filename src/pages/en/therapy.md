I specialize in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), an emotion-focused approach which aims to identify the mechanisms responsible for the emergence and maintenance of emotional difficulties. This approach explores the **cognitive** (e.g., depressive ruminations or anxious worries), **behavioral** (e.g., avoidance), **physiological** and **affective/emotional** aspects, which are often interconnected. CBT adopts an "evidenced-based" approach, based on the latest advances in scientific research. 

The therapeutic process typically begins with an initial session during which we explore and assess your specific challenges together. The follow-up modules are then selected collaboratively and tailored to address the difficulties identified. This approach draws on various CBT-based modalities, including Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Metacognitive Therapy, Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders, and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT).

## In Practice

Each session lasts **50 minutes** and can be conducted in English or French. It is advisable to begin therapy with weekly sessions, subsequently adjusting the frequency based on your needs.

## Difficulties Treated Include

-   Anxiety (panic attacks, panic disorder, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, agoraphobia, specific phobia, etc.)
-   Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
-   Stress management (e.g. at school or university)
-   Professional burnout
-   Treatment of mental ruminations (anxious anticipations or preoccupations, depressive ruminations)
-   Perfectionism
-   Mood disorders (depression, chronic fatigue, etc.)
-   Self-confidence and assertiveness

## Group Therapy

I also offer different therapeutic groups focusing on: 
- Ruminations and worrying 
- Self-confidence and assertiveness training
- Emotion identification and regulation 

For therapeutic reasons, the number of participants is limited to 4 to 6 people. For further information about these groups, please feel free to contact me by email at [psychologue.elisegrimm@gmail.com](mailto:psychologue.elisegrimm@gmail.com).
